                    <div>
                        <p> Pratheepa is an engineer by degree but a writer by passion. She has 2.5 years of
                            experience as an Assistant Manager in a public sector bank. But most of all, being a
                            mom is her pride and comfort. So she coined a profession around her two
                            passions—writing and family. </p>
                        <p> She is a versatile content writer with 3+ years of experience in different genres of
                            writing. Having worked with a variety of clients, she has an eye for detail and
                            people. Pratheepa is also a published co-author of three anthologies: ‘An Unheard
                            Soul,’ ‘Light Through the Crevices,’ and ‘A Little More of Life.’ </p>
                        <p> With Pietential, she has finally found a place to strike a balance in her life as an
                            inquirer, writer, and awareness creator! She is the Awareness Team Lead at
                            Pietential, and she is responsible for taking Pietential’s mission forward
                            seamlessly alongside her team. </p>

                    <p> Jonathan is a student and observer of human and non-human nature, dedicated to serving
                        the wellbeing and flourishing of others through direct personal encounters and
                        leveraging interventions to impact wider audiences positively. </p>

                    <p> He draws on more than 30 years of studying consciousness in Eastern and Western
                        traditions, from scientific-rationalist and contemplative-experiential perspectives, and
                        more importantly, immersed in the living book of wisdom called Life. His mindset
                        resonates with the philosophy behind Pietential’s embrace of Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy
                        of Needs, drawing him closer to the company’s purpose. </p>

                    <p> Jonathan is a husband, and father to a young daughter, seeking to do as little harm as
                        possible to the Earth and others (human and non-human). This is foundational to his
                        service work and gives him tremendous freedom to channel his work outside the family
                        into projects that truly care for the psychic and physical environment. </p>

                    <p> To truly be of benefit to oneself and others, the work one does must be in integrity
                        with the way one lives, and this life practice guides Jonathan as a professional. </p>

                            Consequently, he finds his areas of interest leaning toward psychological avenues of
                            art and literature. </p>
                        <p> Abdullah holds about three years of experience in content writing and creation
                            across various companies. He has also been part of many NGO campaigns and holds the
                            position of Joint Secretary at ‘Unite for Change Foundation Trust.’ With the
                            combination of skills he holds and the desire to bring change, Abdullah feels
                            naturally connected with Pietential. When away from work, you can find him gaming,
                            binging through series or movies, and sometimes preparing his bike for an
                            adventurous trip. Apart from the role of Event Coordinator, Abdullah also helps in
                            research and writing at Pietential. </p>

                    <div>
                        <p> Oroosa holds a postgraduate degree in English Literature and loves spinning words to
                            create new realities. Apart from being a writer, Oroosa is an orator, poetry
                            performer, and food connoisseur. She takes delight in exploring the human mind
                            through works of art, literature, and philosophy—something that has helped her adopt
                            multiple outlooks on life.</p>
                        <p> Ms. Anwar holds over three years of expertise in personal branding and content
                            creation, aside from curating marketing material for individuals and businesses.
                            Oroosa is also an ardent scholar and fights for gender equality, social justice, and
                            her literary interests through research projects. And Pietential is where she seeks
                            to amalgamate her scholarly and marketing sensibilities to create an exponential
                            impact. For her, words are where all the magic happens, so she gives them her all.
                        </p>
                        <p> Apart from writing and researching, Oroosa seeks pleasure in reading comics,
                            savoring dank memes, or cooking something up in the kitchen! </p>
