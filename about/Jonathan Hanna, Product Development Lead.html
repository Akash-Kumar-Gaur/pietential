<h3> Jonathan Hanna, Product Development Lead</h3>
<p> Jonathan is a student and observer of human and non-human nature, dedicated to serving the wellbeing and flourishing of others through direct personal encounters and leveraging interventions to impact wider audiences positively. </p>

<p> He draws on more than 30 years of studying consciousness in Eastern and Western traditions, from scientific-rationalist and contemplative-experiential perspectives, and more importantly, immersed in the living book of wisdom called Life. His mindset resonates with the philosophy behind Pietential’s embrace of Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, drawing him closer to the company’s purpose. </p>

<p> Jonathan is a husband, and father to a young daughter, seeking to do as little harm as possible to the Earth and others (human and non-human). This is foundational to his service work and gives him tremendous freedom to channel his work outside the family into projects that truly care for the psychic and physical environment. </p>

<p> To truly be of benefit to oneself and others, the work one does must be in integrity with the way one lives, and this life practice guides Jonathan as a professional. </p>
