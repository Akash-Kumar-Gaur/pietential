        <p class="aboutTeam">
          <b style="margin-right: 3px;">John Starling</b> has dedicated his life to helping
          people define and achieve what's important to them and is the
          creator of "Pietential".<br />
          Since 1999 he's owned and operated several management consulting
          firms and has been a trusted business advisor and coach to nearly
          400 companies (from start-ups to Fortune 50 companies) and countless
          individuals. <br />
          He is currently in private practice as a professional coach
          (Starling Growth Advisory) and leads CEO peer advisory groups for
          Learner Leader Cohorts.<br />
          In 2010 he founded a first of its kind MMA (Mentoring & Martial
          Arts) school for low-income, at-risk youth in Baltimore. <br />
          In 2016 he founded a girls' soccer club for elementary-aged school
          girls in South Korea who had no opportunity to play organized sports
          in their schools due to institutional and cultural gender
          discrimination. <br />
          A creative at his core, John is an Americana singer-songwriter and
          the author of a children's book about being okay with being
          yourself, "Flight of the Platypus"—a story of self-discovery.
