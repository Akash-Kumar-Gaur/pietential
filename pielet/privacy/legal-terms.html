Confidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, or reliance upon, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

     <p> <b> 9.2. </b> <w:sdt sdttag="goog_rdk_32" id="-785808956"></w:sdt><b> Protection of Confidential Information. </b> Except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will (a) use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (b) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose not authorized by these Terms; and (c) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to, and disclosure of, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with these Terms and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of these Terms or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel, and accountants without the other party’s prior written consent; provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel, or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s, or accountant’s compliance with this “Confidentiality” section.

If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. </p>

      <p> Provisions
      Applicable in all Countries.  As these

      governed either by: (a) codification of Article 2 or 2A of the Uniform

      <p> Dispute
      Resolution  </p>
      
      <p> Informal
      Resolution. Subject to the section below titled “Enforcement; Equitable Relief;
      IP Disputes,” Pietential and you agree to try for 60 days to resolve any
      dispute under or in connection with these Terms (a “Dispute”) informally.  If the parties cannot settle any Dispute
      during this time period, then subject to the section below titled “Enforcement;
      Equitable Relief; IP Disputes”: (a) the parties agree to enter binding
      arbitration (as defined in this section), and not to sue in court in front of a
      judge or jury; and (b) if your principal place of business is located in the
      United States, Canada, the Caribbean or anywhere else in North America, Central
      America or South America, the parties also agree that class action lawsuits,
      class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other
      proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity are not allowed, nor
      is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.  </p>
      
      <p> Service of
      Process and Notice of Dispute. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
      law or by any rules of any applicable arbitrators, courts or other tribunals,
      the parties to these Terms hereby designate each of their respective corporate
      officers (including the President, CEO, and other C-level executives or
      equivalents), if applicable, as agents to receive service of process by
      delivery via a reputable overnight courier to the receiving party’s address on
      file with the government registry of that party’s jurisdiction of organization
      or formation.  Each party hereby
      acknowledges and agrees that such service of process shall be adequate and
      sufficient as if it were made by formal service of process pursuant to
      applicable laws or rules.    </p>
      
      <p> If you wish
      to raise a Dispute and Pietential’s customer service representatives cannot
      resolve it, a Notice of Dispute should be sent by postal mail to Pietential,
      ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT which includes: your name, address, how to contact you,
      the problem your wish to raise, and your preferred means of resolution.  Pietential will do the same if Pietential has
      a dispute with you.  After 60 days,
      subject only to exception set forth in this section, you or Pietential may
      start arbitration in accordance with this section if the dispute is unresolved.  </p>
      
      <p> Exclusive
      Forum and Place of Arbitration.  U.S.,
      Canada, Caribbean and the Americas.  If
      your principal place of business (or primary residence, if you are an
      individual) is located in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean or anywhere
      else in North America, Central America or South America, and a Dispute was not
      resolved through the informal resolution process described above then: (a) such
      Dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
      Rules of the American Arbitration Association; and (b) any such arbitration
      shall be conducted in the English language in  <w:sdt sdttag="goog_rdk_20" id="142784838"></w:sdt> New
      Castle County, Delaware by a sole arbitrator.  </p>
      
      <p> Exclusive
      Forum and Place of Arbitration.  United
      Kingdom, Europe and Elsewhere. If your principal place of business (or primary
      residence, if you are an individual) is located in the United Kingdom, Europe
      or anywhere other than North America, Central America or South America, and a
      Dispute was not resolved through the informal resolution process described
      above then: (a) such Dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the
      Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, as amended by
      this section; and (b) any such arbitration shall be conducted in the English
      language in London, England by a sole arbitrator.  </p>
      
      <p> Appointment
      of Arbitrator. For the purposes of the arbitration, a single arbitrator shall
      be selected by the parties, in default of which the arbitrator shall be
      appointed in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator elected by the parties must be
      a qualified attorney, solicitor or barrister with at least 10 years of
      post-qualification practice experience, and also have experience in the fields
      of software development and distribution and intellectual property disputes (together,
      the “Requirements”).  In appointing an
      arbitrator, the arbitral tribunal must, as far as possible, have regard to the
      Requirements.   </p>
      
      <p> Limitations.
      To the extent permitted by applicable law, you must commence arbitration of any
      Dispute within one year of the date on which the relevant cause of action
      accrued (or, if later, within one year of the date on which the innocent party
      ought reasonably to have become aware of such an accrual), otherwise it is
      permanently barred.  The arbitrator shall
      be bound by the provisions of these Terms and base the decision on applicable
      law and judicial precedent, shall include in such decision the findings of fact
      and conclusions of law upon which the decision is based, and shall not grant
      any remedy or relief that a court could not grant under applicable law.  Except to the extent otherwise expressly
      provided in applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator's decision shall be
      final and binding upon the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal.    </p>
      
      <p> Enforcement;
      Equitable Relief; IP Disputes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
      Dispute Resolution section: (a) either party may enforce any judgment rendered
      by the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction; (b) the arbitrator
      shall have the right to issue equitable relief, including preliminary
      injunctive relief; (c) Pietential shall be entitled to apply to any court of
      competent jurisdiction for any interim relief; (d) Pietential shall be entitled
      to bring, in any court of competent jurisdiction, at any time, any claim
      concerning or related to the enforcement or validity of any intellectual
      property rights (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any trade secrets or
      confidential information) of Pietential or licensors of Pietential (an “IP
      Dispute”); and (e) Pietential shall be entitled, upon receipt of any request
      for arbitration from your under this section, to decline to submit to the
      jurisdiction of any arbitral tribunal insofar as the request for arbitration
      relates to any IP Dispute, in which case you may bring the same IP Dispute in
      any court of competent jurisdiction.   </p>
      
      <p> Attorneys’
      Fees. The rules of the applicable arbitral tribunal will govern payment of
      filing fees and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses, but the prevailing party
      shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  </p>
      
      <p> General  </p>
      
      <p> You agree
      that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment relationship exists
      between you and Pietential and/or affiliates as a result of these Terms or use
      of the Pietential Platform.   <w:sdt sdttag="goog_rdk_21" id="-828896313"></w:sdt><w:sdt sdttag="goog_rdk_22" id="500932656"></w:sdt><a name="_Hlk95387285"> Except for certain third party beneficiary rights granted to

      <p>Except as modified in this DPA, the terms and conditions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. If there is any conflict between this DPA and the Terms regarding Pietential’s privacy or security obligations, the provisions of this DPA shall control. Unless expressly defined in the DPA, all capitalized terms used herein will have the meaning assigned to them in the Terms.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Purpose:&nbsp;</b>The purpose of compliance with Data Protection Laws concerning the processing of Personal Data on behalf of Pietential Platform users located in European Union (“EU”) Member States or members of the European Economic Area, the UK, Canada, and Australia, and incorporates (to the extent applicable) the terms of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”). “Data Protection Law” means, as applicable, the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”), including applicable laws implementing or supplementing the GDPR and as transposed into domestic legislation of Member States, as amended, replaced or superseded from time to time); the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, the Australian Privacy Principles and the Australian Privacy Act (1988); or the Canadian Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. The terms P rocessor, Controller, processing (and process), personal data breach, data protection impact assessment and Personal Data shall have the meanings set out in Data Protection Laws. The term “ Personal Data” includes: first and last name, email address, telephone number, mailing address, and other information necessary to identify an individual for purposes of assisting Pietential with providing use of the Pietential Platform.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Context and Scope of Personal Data Processing:&nbsp;</b>In order to provide the Subscribers with access and use of the Pietential Platform, it may be necessary for Pietential to collect Personal Data of such an individual or an employee or other representative or user of the Subscriber (each, a “Customer Representative”). Such data is collected when Customer Representatives provide their Personal Data directly to Pietential as an account holder, a designated point of contact between Subscriber and Pietential, or a user under the Subscriber account . That data is subsequently used by Pietential solely to provide access to the Pietential Platform and the Pietential Services under the Terms, or as may be necessary to assist with any requests regarding use and proper operation of the Pietential Platform.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Obligations under Data Protection Laws:</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>a.&nbsp;Processing as a Controller. Generally, Pietential shall act as the Controller of the Personal Data of each Customer Representative. As a Controller, Pietential will comply with all data protection requirements under the Data Protection Laws applicable to the Personal Data. Without limiting the foregoing, as a controller of the Personal Data, Pietential shall be responsible for providing notifications to, and respond to inquiries and requests from, the Customer Representatives; provided, however, that to the extent necessary, the Subscriber shall reasonably cooperate with Pietential for the purpose of responding to requests by Customer Representatives or any government authorities and of generally complying with Pietential 's obligations under the Data Protection Laws. To the extent applicable, nothing herein relieves the Subscriber of their own obligations under the applicable Data Protection Laws. The parties are not entering a relationship of joint controllership.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>b.&nbsp;Processing as a Processor. In the event any personal data is processed by Pietential as a Processor, the parties shall specifically identify such personal data and the purposes of processing, as well as the measures undertaken to protect such data, by completing Appendix B (Controller-to-Processor). As a Processor, Pietential shall only process Personal Data in accordance with the Customer Representative’s documented instructions. As required under Data Protection Laws, Pietential shall assist the Customer Representative, where appropriate, in ensuring compliance with the Customer Representative’s obligations pursuant to Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature and scope of Pietential’s Personal Data processing, which may include providing commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance with: (a) data subject requests (see below); (b) notifications or communications regarding personal data breaches; (c) data protection impact assessments; and (d) prior consultations with supervisory authorities.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p>With respect to any Personal Data processed by Pietential as a Processor pursuant to this DPA, Pietential shall: (a) in the event Pietential engages trusted third parties to process Personal Data (“Trusted Parties”), seek the prior specific or general written authorization of the Controller, which is hereby given in respect of any Trusted Parties expressly listed below (and in the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Trusted Parties, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes); (b) unless prohibited under applicable law, upon termination of the Services, at its option, either return or destroy the Personal Data (including all copies of it); (c) ensure that all persons authorized by Pietential to access the Personal Data on Pietential ’s behalf, are subject to obligations of confidentiality in accordance with confidentiality obligations set forth in the Terms; (d) remain fully liable to the Customer Representative or Subscriber for the failure of those persons authorized by Pietential to access the Personal Data on Pietential ’s behalf; and, (e) make available such information as may be necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR and will (at the Customer Representative’s cost and expense) contribute to and allow for appropriate reasonable audits.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Trusted Parties currently engaged to process Personal Data on behalf of Pietential include the following:&nbsp;.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Security:&nbsp;</b>Pietential limits its collection of Personal Data to only that which is relevant for purpose of providing the services under the Terms and retains Personal Data in a form that permits identification of data subjects (defined below) for no longer than is necessary to serve that purpose. Where no defined or legal retention period exists, the default standard retention period is six (6) years plus the year in which the record was created. Pietential shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Data Subject Rights:&nbsp;</b>Within the scope of Data Protection Laws, Customer Representatives located in the EEA, the UK, Canada, or Australia (“data subjects”) may have certain rights that they may exercise, based on jurisdiction, in relation to the processing of their Personal Data. Where applicable, these rights include: the right to access, correct, update, and delete that data subject’s Personal Data, to withdraw any consent to processing, to opt out of communications, to restrict processing of Personal Data, and to make any claim or complaint in relation to their rights under Data Protection Laws, Pietential shall respond to and offer reasonable assistance in responding to data subjects’ requests to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws<b>.</b></p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>Cross Border Data Transfer Mechanisms&nbsp;</b>: To the extent your access and use of the Pietential Platform requires an onward transfer mechanism to lawfully transfer personal data from a jurisdiction to Pietential outside of that jurisdiction, the terms set forth in this section will apply. In the event your access and use of the Pietential Platform is covered by more than one transfer mechanism, the transfer of Personal Data will be subject to a single transfer mechanism in accordance with the following order of precedence: (a) the applicable SCCs as set forth in this section; and, if not applicable, then (b) other applicable data transfer mechanisms permitted under Data Protection Laws.</p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>EU Standard Contractual Clauses</b></p>
      <p><b></b></p>
      <p><b>a.&nbsp;</b><b>Controller-to-Controller&nbsp;</b>: Generally, and unless otherwise specifically identified in Appendix B (Controller to Processor) of this Addendum, all transfers of Personal Data from Subscriber to Pietential shall be deemed a controller-to-controller transfer and shall be made pursuant to Module 1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission on June 4, 2021, as currently set out at in the Annex <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0914&amp;locale=en">here</a>(collectively, the “ Controller SCCs”).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>b.&nbsp;</b><b>Controller-to-Processor:&nbsp;</b>Where Personal Data is transferred from Subscriber to Pietential on a controller-to-processor basis as specifically set forth in Appendix B (Controller to Processor) of this Addendum, the transfer shall be made pursuant to Module 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission on June 4, 2021, as currently set out in the Annex <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?uri=CELEX%3A32021D0914&amp;locale=en">here</a>   (collectively, the “ Processor SCCs”).</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The parties agree to observe the terms of the Processor SCCs without modification, except as to the following selections:</p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
      <li class="lice">In connection with Module 2, Option 2 of Clause 9(a) (Use of sub-processors) is selected and the applicable time period shall be 30 days.</li>
      <li class="lice">Clause 11(a) (Redress) does not select the Option.</li>
      <li class="lice">Clause 13(a): The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.</li>

      <li class="lice">In Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction), the selection in subclause (b) shall be Ireland .</li></ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>In the event of inconsistencies between the provisions of the SCCs and this DPA or other agreements between the parties, the SCCs shall take precedence. The terms of the DPA shall not vary the SCCs in any way. The execution and delivery of this Addendum shall be deemed execution and delivery of the applicable SCCs. The governing law of any applicable SCCs shall be the Member State in which the Subscriber (as Data Exporter) is established, or, if applicable, the UK. Each of the parties’ signatures, authentications, or consents to the Terms shall be considered applicable to the DPA and SCCs as well. If so required by the laws or regulatory procedures of any jurisdiction, the parties shall execute or re-execute the SCCs as separate documents setting out the proposed transfers of Personal Data in such manner as may be required.</p>
