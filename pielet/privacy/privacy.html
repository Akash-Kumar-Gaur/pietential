  <p style="font-size: 14px;"> The Pietential Platform is a
  web- and app-based platform on which subscribers and users can visualize and
  analyze where users stand regarding the core issues that are central to what it
  is to be human: physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem,
  and self-actualization, in an effort to help set and realize goals and
  individual growth potential, or view user general wellbeing on an individual or
  population basis.  </p>
