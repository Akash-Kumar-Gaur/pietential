arbitration (as defined in this section), and not to sue in court in front of a
judge or jury; and (b) if your principal place of business is located in the

is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.  </p>

<p> Service of
Process and Notice of Dispute. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law or by any rules of any applicable arbitrators, courts or other tribunals,
the parties to these Terms hereby designate each of their respective corporate
officers (including the President, CEO, and other C-level executives or
equivalents), if applicable, as agents to receive service of process by
delivery via a reputable overnight courier to the receiving party’s address on
file with the government registry of that party’s jurisdiction of organization
or formation.  Each party hereby
acknowledges and agrees that such service of process shall be adequate and
sufficient as if it were made by formal service of process pursuant to
applicable laws or rules.    </p>

to raise a Dispute and Pietential’s customer service representatives cannot
resolve it, a Notice of Dispute should be sent by postal mail to Pietential,
ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT which includes: your name, address, how to contact you,
the problem your wish to raise, and your preferred means of resolution.  Pietential will do the same if Pietential has

start arbitration in accordance with this section if the dispute is unresolved.  </p>

Canada, Caribbean and the Americas.  If
your principal place of business (or primary residence, if you are an
individual) is located in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean or anywhere

resolved through the informal resolution process described above then: (a) such
Dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association; and (b) any such arbitration
shall be conducted in the English language in  <w:sdt sdttag="goog_rdk_20" id="142784838"></w:sdt> New
Castle County, Delaware by a sole arbitrator.  </p>

<p> Exclusive
Forum and Place of Arbitration.  United
Kingdom, Europe and Elsewhere. If your principal place of business (or primary
residence, if you are an individual) is located in the United Kingdom, Europe
or anywhere other than North America, Central America or South America, and a
Dispute was not resolved through the informal resolution process described
above then: (a) such Dispute shall be finally settled in accordance with the
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, as amended by
this section; and (b) any such arbitration shall be conducted in the English
language in London, England by a sole arbitrator.  </p>

<p> Appointment
of Arbitrator. For the purposes of the arbitration, a single arbitrator shall
be selected by the parties, in default of which the arbitrator shall be
appointed in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator elected by the parties must be
a qualified attorney, solicitor or barrister with at least 10 years of
post-qualification practice experience, and also have experience in the fields
of software development and distribution and intellectual property disputes (together,
the “Requirements”).  In appointing an
arbitrator, the arbitral tribunal must, as far as possible, have regard to the
Requirements.   </p>

<p> Limitations.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you must commence arbitration of any
Dispute within one year of the date on which the relevant cause of action
accrued (or, if later, within one year of the date on which the innocent party
ought reasonably to have become aware of such an accrual), otherwise it is
permanently barred.  The arbitrator shall
be bound by the provisions of these Terms and base the decision on applicable
law and judicial precedent, shall include in such decision the findings of fact
and conclusions of law upon which the decision is based, and shall not grant
any remedy or relief that a court could not grant under applicable law.  Except to the extent otherwise expressly
provided in applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator's decision shall be
final and binding upon the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal.    </p>

<p> Enforcement;
Equitable Relief; IP Disputes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Dispute Resolution section: (a) either party may enforce any judgment rendered
by the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction; (b) the arbitrator
shall have the right to issue equitable relief, including preliminary
injunctive relief; (c) Pietential shall be entitled to apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction for any interim relief; (d) Pietential shall be entitled
to bring, in any court of competent jurisdiction, at any time, any claim
concerning or related to the enforcement or validity of any intellectual
property rights (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any trade secrets or
confidential information) of Pietential or licensors of Pietential (an “IP
Dispute”); and (e) Pietential shall be entitled, upon receipt of any request
for arbitration from your under this section, to decline to submit to the
jurisdiction of any arbitral tribunal insofar as the request for arbitration
relates to any IP Dispute, in which case you may bring the same IP Dispute in
any court of competent jurisdiction.   </p>

<p> Attorneys’
Fees. The rules of the applicable arbitral tribunal will govern payment of
filing fees and the arbitrator’s fees and expenses, but the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  </p>

<p> General  </p>

<p> You agree
that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment relationship exists
between you and Pietential and/or affiliates as a result of these Terms or use

of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and
liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining
provisions in these Terms shall continue in effect.  </p>

<p> These Terms
(and any other terms, policies, guidelines, or agreements referenced herein or
executed between you and Pietential, as applicable, including the Subscriber
Terms of Use and the Acceptable Use Policy) constitute the entire agreement
between you and Pietential with respect to the Pietential Platform and
supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether

of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible
in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms
to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  </p>
