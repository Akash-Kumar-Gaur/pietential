{"SA1":"Self-actualization is not a conscious process for you, and you might not be aware of its effect on you and those around you. However, this may give you an opportunity for a lot more potential in this area. <br><br>Self-actualization has many meanings, but its essence remains the same in each one: to realize your authentic self and reach your full potential. In this sense, self-actualization is learning and actualizing the purpose of being human.<br><br>Your self-actualization process will improve the more you're able to be yourself without any adverse consequences, and that can only happen if you choose to do it consciously. It is possible that you never felt safe being yourself, but you can change that by taking small steps towards self-discovery and self-acceptance. <br><br>You deserve to reach your fullest potential regardless of your past pain, present circumstances, or future fears. A simple mindful shift in mindset can be a huge step toward self-actualization.<br><br>Dedicate some personal time to meditate and reflect on who you are and what you want in life. The more mindful and self-aware you become, the more clarity you'll have to realize and actualize your potential.<br><br>Any day is a good day to start. The more conscious and present you become, the more potential you'll see in yourself and others.","SA2":"You might have embarked on a journey of self-actualization, or it might be in its early stages. Though solitary in its nature at times, the journey is very much a shared experience with many people around the world experiencing similar struggles and anxieties about who they are or who they are capable of being.<br><br>Self- actualization is not merely discovering what potential you have, but more importantly, it's about realizing this potential and becoming the best version of yourself you can be. It is a process of continual discovery; sometimes, you make small discoveries and, at other times, bigger ones.<br><br>Your desire for self-actualization means you're not afraid of what it takes to be your authentic self. You may still be figuring out what that means or how to go about it, but you're actively seeking knowledge and guidance, and that's already a big step towards the fulfillment of your human potential.<br><br>Your self-actualization journey will be more rewarding if you share your experiences with others who are on similar journeys. Unfortunately, self-actualization is not something many people talk about openly, so the best way to learn more is by talking to people who are consciously self-actualizing, or are actively seeking that state.<br><br>Self-Actualization is not about becoming perfect but being aware of your authentic self and capable of utilizing its potential. Do not worry that your authentic self isn't perfect because it's constantly evolving, but remember that acceptance is the first step to let it evolve.<br><br>The journey of self-actualization is an ongoing process that requires courage, dedication, and responsibility to oneself. It's important that you don't put yourself down or give up on yourself because learning how to value yourself takes time.<br><br>You already have the power to excel and achieve your full potential. It's a matter of believing in yourself and manifesting that vision of your best self.","SA3":"You seem to be aware that self-actualization is a process—not a result, and you're consciously self-actualizing (seeking to be the best you that you can be), knowing well what effect that has on you and others around you.<br><br>Your innate desire to be your most authentic Self is an inspiration to so many people who may not have come to know, accept, or embrace themselves in the way you have cared for your Self. The world will greatly benefit if you express yourself to others as you do to yourself.<br><br>Your gift is being you. Share yourself openly with the world, and lead by example. Shine your light as brightly as you possibly can, and others will follow. You may light up the world someday, and you'll definitely light up a few faces and light some minds on fire along the way.<br><br>Whatever you do—don't stop! Keep seeking knowledge, wisdom, and mentorship toward the truly important things to you, and share them openly.<br><br>Teaching is learning.","EC1":"Self-esteem is the basic, fundamental belief that we are worthy beings deserving of all that is good in this world. <br><br>People who have a solid foundation of self-esteem try to make this world a better place and effect change. They recognize their potential and do not let fear or other limiting factors prevent them from pursuing it. You seem to be lacking a solid foundation of self-esteem, and as a result, perhaps you're not able to contribute as much as you'd like.<br><br>Your desire to be more positive is admirable, but you should stop focusing on what's wrong with your life and yourself. But rather, try to change your perspective and look for what you can appreciate about yourself right now.<br><br>Always remember that the first step to increasing your self-esteem is identifying where it's coming from: if it's based on others' opinions of you, then that's a false and temporary kind of self-esteem; if it's rooted in your self-trust on your own unique characteristics, then you have a solid foundation of self-esteem.<br><br>Make a list of your good qualities and the things you like about yourself. Try to think of more things over time and focus on making choices that bring out those qualities.<br><br>You may need to seek professional help (a therapist, counselor, professional coach, etc.) if you can't think of any qualities or aspects about yourself that you like, or appreciate. Seeking help doesn't mean that you're an inadequate person, but rather that you need support to realize all that you have to offer the world. Some counselors specialize in helping people with low self-esteem increase their confidence and feel more positive about themselves.<br><br>It may not be easy to believe right now, but you have a lot to offer this world, and your life will get better from here. So choose to have faith in yourself.","EC2":"Your self-esteem is a work in progress, and you're still working to determine what makes you feel good and confident about yourself, and that’s okay.<br><br>You know that self-esteem is based on our beliefs about ourselves, but we often don't stop to think about why we believe those things or whether those beliefs are accurate. As a result, we may develop some distorted views about ourselves and the world.<br><br>You shouldn't beat yourself up if you struggle with self-esteem—we all do at times. The question is whether you're willing to take action to change that. Step back and think about the reasons why you don't value yourself as much as you could and what you could do to change that.<br><br>The most important thing you can do for your self-esteem is to stop thinking about it as a static, unchanging thing. It may be easier said than done right now, but if you focus on looking at yourself from an objective perspective and give yourself room to make mistakes without being too hard on yourself, you'll learn how you feel about yourself over time. Seek professional help if you're having trouble figuring out how you feel about yourself because this may indicate a deeper issue.<br><br>Your contributions to others and the world will increase when you learn to value yourself more. You are worthy of love, respect, and happiness. You don't have to go out into the world today feeling confident that you'll be loved by everyone you meet, but start small—address your needs in little ways.<br><br>If someone makes a comment that hurts your feelings, respond by telling them how it made you feel rather than ignoring it or lashing back at them. Your good deeds and positive contributions to the world will increase when you take steps to say no to things that make you feel bad about yourself, stand up for yourself in respectful, non-aggressive ways, and learn how to love yourself more each day.","EC3":"You have strong, healthy self-esteem, and you're a contributor in this world—and there's an important relationship between the two.<br><br>Your ability to contribute to the world is likely based on your foundation of self-esteem. In contrast, some people's self-esteem is dependent on how good they make others feel and the recognition they get from their contributions.<br><br>Good self-esteem is often rooted in positive childhood life experiences. It allows us to be contributors to society because we choose to do so, not as a means to feel good about ourselves or to fill a perceived void within ourselves.<br><br>You may or may not have come to fully understand or embrace your purpose in life, but it's a great time to begin considering big questions like this because defining, articulating, and sharing your purpose with others could result in your becoming a super-contributor.<br><br>Contributors effect change in society at the interpersonal and group levels—and that's amazing in and of itself. Super-contributors affect the world at the community and meta-level, and even the global level, and you're capable of that.<br><br>Studying from teachers, mentors, and coaches who are operating a level or two up from where you are effecting change would benefit you if you're interested in operating at a higher level. Some personal development coursework would also speed your trajectory toward those aims.","LB1":"We all have love in our hearts, but many of us don't know how to show it or receive it from others. Sometimes a series of bad experiences can make us close our hearts to human connection, even though we crave it. Whether you're someone who's shut it down unconsciously or someone who tries but always gets hurt even though you're giving your all, it's possible that your subconscious fears could be limiting your ability to love and feel loved genuinely.<br><br>Start by identifying the experiences that have made you feel alienated, unlovable, or unworthy of love. Look at yourself through the eyes of compassion rather than judgment, and you will be able to recognize some of your own ​missteps while also being able to see the actions of others as symptoms of their own fears and wounds. In doing so, you'll be able to see how other people were also trying to protect themselves from being hurt, even if it meant hurting you in the process.<br><br>Unsatisfying relationships are often the result of a lack of self-love. But it's not because you can't love others without self-love, but maybe because you just don't like yourself enough to allow anyone to truly get close and see the real you.  You don't have to wait for those fears to go away to start opening yourself up—you can begin showing the vulnerable, authentic side of you as much as possible. Start sharing what you're afraid of thinking or feeling with those closest to you, and challenge yourself to initiate conversations that make you feel vulnerable.<br><br>The sense of belonging you're looking for is already within you, but you have to allow yourself to feel it rather than tell yourself that it doesn't exist for you. So, sometimes we need to change our company, even when the thought of that scares us or looks like it's impossible. But sometimes, we also need to change ourselves by opening up our hearts and allowing the love that's already there to be expressed.<br><br>It might feel like no one can help you or that there's no one out there who can relate to your experiences, but this world is full of people who have been through similar experiences. There's always someone who will hear what you're saying and understand your pain. So be brave, and take the first few steps towards that connection. Know that you're worthy of love and belonging, and commit to receiving and giving it unconditionally.<br><br>Whatever the position you find yourself in, know that it's okay—it's part of the human experience to find ourselves frightened and alone, but you belong in this world just as much as every single other person on this planet does.","LB2":"You're fairly well balanced in the realm of love and belonging but still have room for improvement. Perhaps you haven't found your perfect match yet, or you don't feel perfectly loved by your partner/friends/family... perhaps because you haven't given them a chance to understand you fully, or feel they lack the compassion to allow you to be vulnerable. Maybe it's no one's fault at all, but just a matter of timing or circumstances, so try not to get frustrated or blame it on yourself.<br><br>Your heart is full of love—more than enough for everyone—but your mind can sometimes get in the way by second-guessing yourself and worrying about what others will think of you if you're open and honest about your feelings. Maybe past experiences have shown you that love doesn't last forever, so, understandably, you might be wary of opening yourself up to other people. Instead, try not to let your fear and insecurities get in the way of experiencing (and sharing) love and happiness with others.<br><br>The truth is that everyone has the same fears of intimacy and vulnerability. Most people would rather risk hurting you than be judged or rejected by you. You might think they don't want to be close to you, but really they're just trying to protect themselves like everyone else.<br><br>But even though there's a sense of loneliness in your life, your love and belonging needs are mostly being met through your strong emotions and heartfelt act of service. You may not feel like you have a lot of people in your life, but those who are there for you make up for the small numbers by being incredibly loyal and supportive.<br><br>You might benefit from pushing yourself to make more connections by initiating conversation with those you rarely talk to, whether at work, school, or amongst your social circle. Be brave and share the real you with the people close to you—trust that they're willing to listen and understand, and give them a chance to prove what kind of people they really are.<br><br>As you allow your heart to open up and take more risks, you'll find that sharing yourself with others actually brings about feelings of happiness and love in return.","LB3":"Your relationship with yourself is a good one. You love yourself and have compassion for yourself—and that's the root of love and compassion you are able to show others.<br><br>Authenticity is an important lever in the realm of love and belonging, and you probably show up pretty authentically in the groups and communities in which you operate. So, continue this practice, and work to become even more authentic because it will increase your compassion for your fellow human beings and embed you even deeper into your community as a compassionate leader.<br><br>Your love for yourself allows you a certain level of intimacy with yourself that not everyone has access to, and that level of personal intimacy transcends you and works its way into your personal relationships. People are okay being intimate with you, whether in conversation or physically because you're okay with intimacy. You radiate this in your words, actions, and being—and people are attracted to you because of it.<br><br>Your foundation of love and belonging is a strong one, and with some additional nurturing and perhaps some formal training, you could become a true force for compassion and healing in your world. You might consider taking some personal development courses to increase your natural capacity for love and belonging.<br><br>At the same time, be careful not to take on too much. Being present, powerful, and compassionate toward others can give you energy, but only when you have it to give. Your natural strength in this area can be a beacon to people who feel deficient in this realm, drawing them to you as they seek your energy and love to compensate for their own lack of love and sense of belonging.<br><br>Make sure your own needs in this area are well taken care of so you don't overextend yourself and begin to feel drained by something that should give you joy.","SN1":"Without a sense of safety, life feels chaotic, unpredictable, and physically and emotionally overwhelming. You might dread not having basic necessities like food, shelter, security, and emotional well-being. But even when you secure these necessities, your worrying can still be paralyzing. Without developing the trust that things will work out for the best, you allow your anxieties to haunt you, draining your sanity and undermining your happiness.<br><br>The core problem may be that you feel abandoned and betrayed by those who were supposed to ensure your safety, whether it was a family member, friend, significant other, or your own past self. So, a core solution may lie in taking steps to become more self-reliant and learning from your past mistakes.  You might start by identifying your most urgent necessity and setting realistic, achievable goals around them. <br><br>You can also try looking at your life through a different lens—one of abundance rather than scarcity; courage instead of fear; growth over stagnation. While these may sound like simple positive affirmations, they are actually helpful ways to approach the core issue from a more empowering perspective. Once you adopt this mindset, it becomes easier to trust yourself and achieve your goals.  Gratefulness is a great place to start, wherever you are, and regardless of what you’re trying to achieve.<br><br>Financial insecurity is a tough obstacle to overcome, which only those people who've endured it can fully understand. Don't let others discourage you or minimize your situation. Taking a job, you don’t like just to put food on the table doesn't mean you can't ever get to where you want to be.  If you plan ahead, work on small achievable goals, save money no matter how small the amount, and grab hold of any opportunities that may assist you in moving forward, you'll slowly but surely, find that your financial situation will become much more manageable over time.<br><br>Poor emotional and mental health are both symptoms and causes of unmet safety needs. As you begin to address your core fears, you will be able to work on achieving balance. <br><br>Take your destiny into your own hands by taking a chance on yourself, believing that things will work out for the best no matter what the future holds, not because of blind faith but because you are willing to work hard to get what you want and because you deserve certainty.","SN2":"As you work to meet your safety, security, and stability needs, something always comes up, preventing you from fully thriving. As a result, you might feel like you are just trying to survive day-to-day rather than getting the most out of life. <br><br>When you feel constantly endangered, it is difficult to trust yourself and the world around you. It directly impacts your emotional and mental health and drains your energy, which in turn can affect your performance at work and your personal relationships.<br><br>Even when your average sense of safety is good, your life might feel chaotic and unpredictable because you are constantly on edge to survive. You may fear that any moment could be the one that sets off a chain of events that will lead to your downfall.<br><br>To begin feeling safe and secure in all areas of your life – not just one – create a safety plan: develop realistic goals and make a step-by-step plan to achieve them. Upon doing so, you will realize that your plans are achievable and thus learn to trust yourself. You can then begin to let go of some of the unnecessary fears that plague your mind daily, like fear of failure or rejection.<br><br>Focus on saving money for emergencies and securing a stable income. These practices will help you feel more secure in the short term and teach you to trust yourself, knowing that you can survive and bounce back if anything goes wrong.<br><br>If the people who were supposed to protect you made it difficult for you to trust others, it might be time to cut the cord and pursue healthier relationships. Only allow people who respect you to remain in your life. But above all, self-awareness and constant self-development are key to long-term safety, security, and stability.<br><br>It's time to let go of old fears and see yourself as someone who is worthy of success because you are!","SN3":"You have a reasonable amount of certainty in your life regarding fundamental issues of safety and security, and that allows you to act from a spirit of abundance rather than scarcity.<br><br>This foundation of safety gives you a strong basis of emotional balance and personal fortitude and makes you a rational actor in times when issues like housing security, food security, or personal safety might be in question. You know what safety and security in these areas look and feel like; thus, you know they are always attainable, even if life circumstances sometimes raise temporary doubts about them.<br><br>Your core relationship to money is likely healthy, which is a key part of your foundation regarding the issues above. However, you might consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial advisor or retirement specialist and develop a long-term plan to maintain and grow your financial assets over time. Doing so can alleviate some of the unspoken anxieties you might feel in these areas, freeing up your attention to apply to other important areas of your life.","PN1":"Not everyone is non-disabled; if you have a disability, chronic illness, or mental health issue, you may need to be extra compassionate to yourself and try your best to take care of yourself. No one knows how to take care of themselves better than you. Look out for your triggers, and don't be afraid or ashamed to ask for help; nobody can do it all alone.<br><br>But if you're physically and mentally able, it's time to do some soul-searching. Are you happy with your current level of fitness? When was the last time you exercised, ate healthily, or slept on time? If your answer is \"a long time ago\" or \"I don't really know,\" it's probably time to get serious and start taking better care of yourself.<br><br>There can be many reasons for not taking care of your body, some more serious than others. If you're struggling with addiction, seeking professional help is a must. It can be difficult to admit there's a problem, especially an addiction that you feel you have no control over. But the human will is a powerful thing; you can overcome addiction if you truly want to, and accepting help is the first step.<br><br>Our body requires nourishment, exercise, and physical and mental rest. So, if you're not feeling your best or productive due to fatigue or illness, it's your body's way of saying that you've been neglecting it.<br><br>You can work with a nutritionist or a personal trainer to make a plan for you. They will help you figure out what your body needs specifically and teach you how to take better care of yourself going forward. If you can't afford to work with them, don't worry. There are great resources online that you can follow for free! <br><br>Make the necessary changes to get yourself back on track.","PN2":"You may go back and forth between taking really good care of yourself and not caring about your own well-being. Try to get into a consistent rhythm with a regular schedule. It's important to make yourself a priority, even if it feels selfish, remember you are no good for anyone else if you're not taking care of yourself.<br><br>Keep track of what makes you feel good/bad so that you can modify your habits accordingly. Also, keep an eye on people who are negative influences on you because they could be lowering your mood and making you feel worse about yourself.<br><br>We can't control many things in life; many visible and non-visible disabilities are part of that. If you have any, the key is finding the balance between what you can take care of and accepting help when needed.<br><br>You might be too hard on yourself or not recognize your achievements. Instead, try permitting yourself to feel good about what you've accomplished and treating yourself with kindness.<br><br>You're doing okay; keeping your body in shape is an important part of who you are, but it can always be better. If you don't have any underlying health conditions, you should push yourself to nurture your body even more.<br><br>If you sometimes drink alcohol, smoke, or use other intoxications, take a moment to think about how much better your life would be if you didn't do it. If your answer is \" a lot,\" look for help from the people around you and other resources before it becomes a problem even tougher to solve.<br><br>Always remember, prevention is better than cure: If you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed out, or tired, take a step back and re-evaluate your daily life before it's too late. The body is a wonderful machine that adapts to its environment but only up to a point. So don't wait until you're at rock bottom before deciding it's time for a change.<br><br>Be kind to yourself when you go through tough times. There's no need to beat yourself up or feel guilty about making mistakes. We're not perfect. Be gentle with yourself on your journey of life and growth.","PN3":"Your physiological needs are in pretty good shape. You seem to be taking good care of yourself regarding your general health and well-being, yet there's always room for improvement.<br><br>Long and healthy life is within your reach because you have a solid physiological foundation to build on. You'd be wise to work with a nutritionist and/or personal trainer and start dialing in your nutrition and exercise regimen into your specific needs, considering factors like your age, weight, and your own particular health goals.<br><br>A key to maintaining and growing your good physiological foundation is the company you keep. Therefore, you'd do well to keep your distance from people who smoke, drink excessively, or are recreational drug users, as their lifestyles run counter to yours and could hinder your progress toward an even healthier life."}
