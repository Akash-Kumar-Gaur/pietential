And your inner self is easy to look into.<br><br>Self-actualization is often considered a choice or privilege rather than a need. As a result, we declare that we don’t have time or liberty to focus on self-actualization. Such a mindset fosters self-imposed limitations dictated by imagined boundaries on personal development.<br><br>We don’t realize that self-actualization is not a destination, but a continuous journey. It is the very thing that can help us grow, and become more effective in our lives. We are all self-actualizing almost daily at different points on our paths, but we fail to acknowledge it because we are constantly searching for it in a grand moment of achievement. We have believed the notion that self-actualization is something we only acquire or experience when every other aspect of life is operating at peak performance.<br><br>This could not be further from the truth.<br><br>Self-actualization is the process of becoming your best self; it’s about exploring your potential and finding what fulfills you. And this can happen only when you let go of the idea that you need to be perfect.<br><br>In truth, self-actualization is a byproduct of living authentically while being fully engaged in our lives. It’s the natural outcome of being genuine with ourselves and others alongside constantly seeking growth. Your score might reflect your reluctance in accepting all elements that define your true Self.<br><br>Self-actualization occurs when we are completely honest with what we want and need, and give up everything that isn’t true to our being. We become more authentic as we shed our masks and drop pretenses to appease the idea of plentiful living. We become more genuine as we learn to live in the present moment and let go of our need to control everything.<br><br>We need to not be too hard on ourselves, as many of our victories and accomplishments often get missed by our own eyes. Not every impact is visible or measurable; taking time to reflect and celebrating small wins is the first step toward acknowledging one’s progress. It’s these small triumphs that make us who we are and help us move closer to our ultimate potential.<br><br>Other people can be an inherent part of your personal development and growth toward self-actualization. Connecting with others allows us to see ourselves more objectively through their lenses. Self-evaluation from the perspective of trusted others, when done in moderation, enables us to achieve a broader vision of our Self, including the blind spots.<br><br>Self-actualization doesn’t mean becoming someone different than who you are. Instead, it’s about expanding and deepening your current experience of life to draw more meaning.<br><br>It is imperative to remember that you are more self-actualized than you think, and your willingness to take this test is proof of that. All you need is to keep exploring, learning, and growing, as well as believing, recognizing, and committing to the journey toward self-actualization.<br><br>You’re worthy and capable of achieving all. What’s needed is letting go of your self-limiting beliefs. And the fact that you’re taking this test speaks volumes about your willingness to learn more about yourself and to improve.

But not many will tell you that it is also a basic human need to feel satisfied and understood by others. Most importantly, self-actualization is a tool to understand and converse with yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>How can we possibly know what our talents and passions are if we don’t know who we are? Moreover, without knowing ourselves, we cannot communicate our story and make an impression on the world.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s why <b><i>self-actualization begins with self-awareness</i></b> .</div><div><br></div><div>Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your own thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It’s about seeing yourself objectively, without judgment or biases.</div><div><br></div><div>When you are self-aware, you grow cognizant of your habits, tendencies, and triggers. You also learn to recognize your emotions and find ways to handle them. This enables you to understand yourself better and to make sense of how you interact with the world around you.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you feel like you haven’t achieved self-actualization? Perhaps it is because you haven’t been introspective enough to discover who you truly are. The fact that you realize the importance of achieving self-actualization is itself a great start to your personal development.</div><div><br></div><div>We must always remember that personal development and self-actualization are highly subjective experiences. There is no textbook step-by-step method to discovering oneself; it naturally comes from within. What works for you might not work for somebody else. In general, however, you could try keeping a journal, practicing meditation or mindfulness, or simply paying attention to your daily habits and routines—what is called being “mindful.”</div><div><br></div><div>Among other basic principles to achieving self-actualization, being authentic and honest to oneself is foundational to the entire process. It’s best to be true to yourself without imitating anyone else. Don’t suppress your thoughts, feelings, or emotions: recognize them, accept them, and learn from them.</div><div><br></div><div>The second principle is to live in the present moment. Don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future. The gift of the present is all we have, and it’s where we should focus wholly.</div><div><br></div><div>Connect with other people. Consider sharing your thoughts, feelings, and experiences with others, and listen to theirs in return. This will help you get a deeper insight into yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>And finally, have a growth mindset. Be willing to learn and grow, no matter what. Don’t give up when things get tough. Instead, persevere and keep pushing forward.</div><div><br></div><div>Don’t be afraid if you don’t have all the answers. As humans, we are always in a constant state of learning, so it’s more than okay to not know everything. In fact, not knowing is a real gift, because when we acknowledge and stand comfortably in not knowing it creates space for knowing to occur. You’ll get there, just the way you got where you are right now.

On the contrary, continually self-actualizing is a propellant toward further improvement in all areas of life.</div><div><br></div><div>The process includes learning and living your purpose, seeking education in different forms to practice the mastery of new skills, and achieving the goals that support your purpose.

And before you realize it, your opinion of yourself becomes that of others. But once you start a positive inner dialogue, things will start falling in place for you. That’s where the change comes!<br><br>When you reach a healthy level of self-esteem, you will contribute to other people naturally rather than just to receive appreciation or feel good about yourself. Trust yourself. Nobody knows you better than you do. Remember, everyone deserves to feel the freedom to express themselves. You own your decisions, and nobody has walked in your shoes, so don’t let anyone else demean you.<br><br>Even if you’ve made huge mistakes, you are worthy of redemption and a fair chance at change. Everyone needs to hear this, and the next time you meet someone at the early stage of self-esteem realization, you’ll likely contribute to them in a similar exchange.<br><br>Root for yourself, and you will realize that you do have the power to make things happen.

It’s natural to measure ourselves against the expectations of others, but there’s something more important than that. How do we measure ourselves against our own expectations? And by what parameters?</div><div><br></div><div>Most people would say they have a good amount of self-respect, but many people often report that they don’t know if their life has a purpose—and if it does, what that purpose is. Without a defined purpose, it’s hard to measure what our contributions have or have not been, what they are, or what they could be. And though we might like to think of our self-esteem as something that exists in a vacuum (either we have it, or we don’t) it’s often relative.</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>Self-esteem is relative to our expectations of ourselves, others’ expectations of us, and most importantly, our spoken or unspoken sense of purpose</i></b>. It’s worthwhile to consider your purpose in life, to begin having that conversation with yourself, with your friends and family—and in your social circles. You don’t have to have the answer in order to start sharing that inner monologue in your dialogue with others. It will come.</div><div><br></div><div>What matters is whether you’re making powerful conversations about a purpose-driven life; then you can assess whether you’ve made the contributions you want to make in this world and whether you’ve been properly recognized for them—and if it even matters to you. To some people, rejection doesn’t matter. Does it affect you?</div><div><br></div><div>Living from a declarative purpose enables personal empowerment, inner strength, and self-expression to give way to the power of your purpose naturally. The barometer of self-esteem is raised and contributions become more meaningful.</div><div><br></div><div>However, if you find that you don’t have a clear purpose yet, that’s OK. It just means that you’ve identified an opportunity for growth. As long as you’re humble and open to it, the process of finding your purpose can be one of the most rewarding experiences you’ll ever have.</div><div><br></div><div>Just keep moving toward growth at a comfortable pace, and you’ll soon discover new angles to yourself!</div>","EC3":"<div><b><i>Your accomplishments are worth being noted, so give yourself the credit you deserve.</i></b></div><div><br></div><div>Your score suggests you’re getting the hang of building your self-esteem.
