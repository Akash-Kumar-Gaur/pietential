You have a strong, healthy self-esteem, and you're a contributor in this world - and there's an important relationship between the two.<br><br>Your ability to contribute to the world is likely based in your foundation of self-esteem, whereas some people's self-esteem is dependent on feeling that they make (or have made) and are recognized for their contributions. Good self-esteem, which is often rooted in positive childhood life experiences, allows us to be contributors to society as an end unto itself, not as a means to fill a perceived void within ourselves.<br><br>You may or may not have really come to understand, or embrace your purpose in life - but it's a great time to begin considering big questions like this, because defining, articulating, and sharing your purpose with others could result in your becoming a super-contributor.<br><br>Contributors affect change in society at the interpersonal level, and at the group level - and that's amazing in and of itself. Super-contributors affect the world at the community and at the meta level, and even the global level, and you're capable of that.<br><br>Studying from teachers, mentors, and coaches who are operating a level or two up from where you are currently affecting change would be of benefit to you if you're interested in operating at a higher level. Some personal development course work would also speed your trajectory towards those aims.
