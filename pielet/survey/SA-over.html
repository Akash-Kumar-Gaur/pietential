You seem to be aware that self actualization is a process - not a result, and you're consciously self-actualizing (seeking to be the best you that you can be) knowing well what effect that has on you, and others around you.<br><br>Your innate desire to be your most authentic self is an inspiration to so many people who may not have come to know, accept, or embrace themselves in the way in which you have. The world would benefit greatly from you working just as hard to express yourself to others, as you do to yourself.<br><br>Your gift is being you. Share yourself openly with the world, and lead by example. Shine your light as bright as you possibly can, and others will follow. You may light up the world someday, and you'll definitely light up a few faces, and light some minds on fire along the way.<br><br>Whatever you do - don't stop. Keep seeking knowledge, wisdom, and mentorship towards the things that are truly important to you - and share it openly.<br><br>Teaching is learning.
