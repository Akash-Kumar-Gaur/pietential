Self Actualization is a process - not a result.<br><br>We are never completely self actualized, though hopefully we are continually self actualizing.&nbsp; All of us are just a work in progress.&nbsp; The quintessential question is are we actively working on it?&nbsp; Am I actively working on me?.&nbsp;<br><br>The answer is&nbsp;“yes”.&nbsp; You are working on it - right now, in fact.&nbsp; You’re working on you - and that’s a good thing.&nbsp; It’s our nature as humans to seek to improve our lot in life, and our life itself.&nbsp;<br><br>Self actualizing people are people who actively engage in this process of&nbsp;“self-improvement” by focusing first on the Self itself; by focusing on their&nbsp;“Being” - and on being the best human being they are capable of being, as fundamental to their well being.<br><br>You might feel inadequate in this regard.&nbsp; Many people do.<br><br>Self actualization looks like a long, steep road of self improvement, where you have to constantly "fix" yourself - but you should consider that choosing to consciously improve your Self does not mean that you’re broken.&nbsp; You are not broken - and you don’t need to be&nbsp;“fixed”.&nbsp;<br><br>You are fundamentally good, and no matter what your state or situation - you can improve your Self itself, and other areas of your life will follow suit: your self esteem, your ability to be a contributor in life, your relationships and sense of belonging, your feelings of safety and security, and your physiological balance.<br><br>“Self Actualization” isn’t a result of having gained some level of achievement in the other fundamental areas of your life.&nbsp; The work of continually self actualizing, is a propellent towards further improvement in all of those areas of life.<br><br>Learning and living your purpose in life, seeking education in all of its forms towards practicing the mastery of new skills and achieving the goals that support your purpose to the point where you feel genuinely fulfilled, and capable of imbuing the possibility of that level of fulfillment to others - today, tomorrow, and the next day, until your short time on this Earth has passed.&nbsp; That’s a self actualizing life - and you’re living it.&nbsp;<br><br>Keep living it.&nbsp; Keep sharing it.
