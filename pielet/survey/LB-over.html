Your relationship with yourself is a good one. You love yourself, and have compassion for yourself - and that's the root of love and compassion your able to show others.<br><br>Authenticity is an important lever in the realm of love and belonging, and you probably show up pretty authentically in the groups and communities in which you operate. Continue this practice, and work to become ever more authentic, as it will increase you compassion for your fellow being and embed you even deeper into your community as a compassionate leader.<br><br>Your love for yourself allows you a certain level of intimacy with yourself that not everyone has access too, and that level of personal intimacy transcends you and works its way into your personal relationships. People are okay being intimate with you, whether in conversation, or physically, because you're okay with intimacy. You radiate this in your words, actions and being - and people are attracted to you, because of it.<br><br>Your foundation of love and belonging is a strong one, and with some additional nurturing, and perhaps some formal training, you could become a true force for compassion and healing in your world. You might consider taking some personal development courses, in order to increase your natural capacity for love and belonging.<br><br>At the same time, be careful not to take on too much. Your natural strength in this area can be a beacon to people who feel deficient in this realm, drawing them to you as they seek your energy and love in order to compensate for their own lack of sense of love and belonging.<br><br>Being present, powerful and compassionate towards others can in fact give you energy, but only when you have it to give. Make sure that your own needs in this area are well taken care of so you don't over-extend yourself and begin to feel drained by something that should give you joy.
