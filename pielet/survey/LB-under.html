Your relationships aren’t as deep and fulfilling as they could be, and (hard as it may be to hear) you’re likely at the root of any deficit you might be feeling regarding love and belonging.<br><br>Shallow or negative social interactions, unhealthy friendships, and poor relationships with our family are often the result of a lack of compassion for ourselves - from ourselves.&nbsp; If we don’t show ourselves compassion; if we can’t be intimate with ourselves; if we can’t drop our defenses and engage in play and truly enjoy our own company how can we expect to show up authentically and have more meaningful relationships with our family, friends, and community?<br><br>Moreover, if we aren’t intimate with ourselves, and showing ourselves and our friends, families and communities our compassion,&nbsp; our passion, and our natural unadulterated playful spirit, then what signals are we putting out to the world - and thus what types of people are we attracting?&nbsp;<br><br>People are like magnets for similarly minded people, and we tend to draw to us people who are similar to what we’re consciously or subconsciously putting out there.<br><br>You might consider taking an inventory of your relationships with your friends and family, and taking a look at the communities in which you’re involved.&nbsp; How are those people showing up?&nbsp; Are they negative?&nbsp; Positive?&nbsp; Compassionate? Cold and unfeeling?&nbsp; Do they show empathy and connectedness?&nbsp; Are their relationships deep or shallow?&nbsp; Are they okay being vulnerable and playful, or are they closed off?&nbsp; Are they authentic, or just operating with others at the level of pretense?&nbsp;<br><br>And how about you?&nbsp; Where can you improve these important areas of your life, and what might be possible for you with an increased opening for love and belonging?<br><br>You might consider working with a life coach, joining a faith-based community, or taking some self improvement courses.&nbsp; What you’ll find in any of those instances is a broader, deeper understanding, and acceptance of your self, which will in turn give you the opportunity to be naturally more connected to others.
