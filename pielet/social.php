    <h1>Realize Your Growth Potential</h1>
    The better you can Visualize it <br>
The more effectively you can Analyze it. <br>
And the easier you can Realize it. <br><br>
 
Pietential is a survey-based life balance visualization tool, developed by John Starling, and based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs.<br><br>

I’ve always been fascinated by Maslow’s Needs, as being the core of what’s common to us all - but I’ve never agreed with it being represented as a hierarchy.
