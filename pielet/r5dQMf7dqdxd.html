    Your Score: 56/100</b>
    
You would benefit from eating better, getting more exercise, and a better night’s sleep.
 
If you consume alcohol, caffeine, or use recreational drugs, these substances may be affecting your ability to sleep well at night, practice mindfulness (be in the moment) during your waking hours, and exercise the following day.
 
Pay special attention to what you’re eating - and when, as the food you eat is providing you your base-level fuel to set and accomplish all of your other goals.
 
Your community is key.  Work to surround yourself with people that are healthier than you, as they’ll be a good influence on your actions. 

Depending on your specific circumstance you might consider working with a nutritionist, personal trainer, talk therapist, or addictions counselor if your actions regarding alcohol and/or drugs have ever caused harm to you or others, and you’ve continued to consume them.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Safety Needs: 
    Your Score: 62/100</b>
    
    You have a reasonable amount of certainty in your life regarding fundamental issues of safety and security, and that allows you to act from a spirit of abundance, rather than scarcity.

This foundation of safety gives you a strong basis of emotional balance and personal fortitude, and makes you a rational actor in times when issues like housing security, food security, and personal safety might be in question. You know what safety and security in these areas look and feel like, thus you know that they are always attainable, even if life circumstances sometimes raise temporary doubts about them.

Your core relationship to money is likely a healthy one, which is a key part of your foundation regarding the issues above. All the same you might consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial advisor, or retirement specialists and developing a long-term plan to maintain and grow your financial assets over time. Doing so can alleviate some of the unspoken anxieties you might feel in these areas, freeing up your attention to apply to other important areas of your life.

    Your Score: 56/100</b>
    
Your relationships aren’t as deep and fulfilling as they could be, and (hard as it may be to hear) you’re likely at the root of any deficit you might be feeling regarding love, and belonging.
    
Shallow or negative social interactions, unhealthy friendships, and poor relationships with our family are often the result of a lack of compassion for ourselves - from ourselves.  If we don’t show ourselves compassion, if we can’t be intimate with ourselves, if we can’t drop our defenses, and engage in play and truly enjoy our own company how can we expect to show up authentically, and have more meaningful relationships with our family, friends, and community?

Moreover, if we aren’t intimate with ourselves, and showing ourselves and our friends, families and communities our compassion,  our passion, and our natural unadulterated, playful spirit, then what signals are we putting out to the world, and thus what types of people are we attracting? 

People are like magnets for similarly minded people, and we tend to draw to us people who are similar to what we’re consciously, or subconsciously putting out there.

You might consider taking an inventory of your relationships with your friends and family, and taking a look at the communities in which you’re involved.  How are those people showing up?  Are they negative?  Positive?  Compassionate? Cold and unfeeling?  Do they show empathy and connectedness?  Are their relationships deep or shallow?  Are they ok being vulnerable and playful, or are they closed off?  Are they authentic, or just operating with others at the level of pretense.  And how about you?  Where can you improve these important areas of your life, and what might be possible for you with an increased opening for love and belonging.

You might consider working with a life coach, joining a faith-based community, or taking some self improvement courses.  What you’ll find in any of those instances is a broader, deeper understanding, and acceptance of your self, which will in turn give you the opportunity to be naturally more connected to others.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Self-Esteem and Contribution: 
    Your Score: 46/100</b>

You may have some doubts about the value of the contributions you make, or have made in your life - to society, community, or even your family - and whether or not people respect what you’ve accomplished.  It’s natural to measure ourselves against the expectations of others, bu

t more importantly is how do measure ourselves against our own expectations.  And by what barometer?
 
Most people would say that they have a good amount of self respect, but many people often report that they don’t know if their life has purpose - and if so, what that purpose is.  Without a defined purpose, it’s hard to measure what our contributions have or or have not been; what they are - or what they could be? And though, we might like to think of our self esteem as existing in a vacuum - we have it, or we don’t - it’s relative: to our expectations or ourselves, to others expectations of us, and most importantly to our spoken or unspoken sense of purpose.
 
It’s worthwhile to consider your purpose in life, to begin having that conversation with yourself, and with your friends, and family - and in your social circles.  You don’t have to have “the answer” in order to start sharing that inner monologue in your dialogue with other.  It will come.
 
What matters is that in you’re in a powerful conversation about a purpose-driven life, and from there you can better gauge for yourself whether you’ve made the contributions that you want to make in this world, and whether you’ve been properly recognized for them - and if that even matters to you.
 
Living from a declarative purpose, nagging questions of self worth, personal empowerment, inner strength, and self expression tend to naturally give way to the power of your purpose.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Self Actualization: 
    Your Score: 47/100</b>
    
Self Actualization is a process - not a result.
    
We are never completely self actualized, though hopefully we are continually self actualizing.  See, all of us are just a work in progress.  The quintessential question is “are we actively working on it?  Am I actively working on me?”. 
 
The answer is “yes”.  You are working on it - right now, in fact.  You’re working on you - and that’s a good thing.

As you know, none of us are perfect, and it’s our nature as humans to seek to improve our lot in life, and our life itself. 

Self actualizing people are people who actively engage in this process of “self-improvement” by focusing first on the Self itself; by focusing on their “Being” - and on being the best being they are capable of being, as fundamental to their well being.

You might feel inadequate in this regard.  Many people do.

Self actualization looks like a long, steep road of self improvement, where you have to constantly fix yourself - but you should consider that choosing to consciously improve your Self does not mean that you’re broken.  You are not broken and you don’t need to be “fixed”. 

You are fundamentally good, and no matter what your state or situation - you can improve your Self itself, and other areas of your life will follow suit: your self esteem, your ability to be a contributor in life, your relationships and sense of belonging, your feelings of safety and security, and your physiological balance.

“Self Actualization” isn’t a result of having gained some level of achievement in the other fundamental areas of your life.  The work of continually self actualizing, is a propellent towards further improvement in all of those areas of life.

Learning and living your purpose in life, seeking education in all of its forms towards practicing the mastery of new skills and achieving the goals that support your purpose to the point where you feel genuinely fulfilled, and capable of imbuing the possibility of that level of fulfillment to others; today, tomorrow, and the next day, until your short time on this Earth has passed. That’s a self actualizing life - and you’re on living it. 

Keep living it. Keep sharing it.
