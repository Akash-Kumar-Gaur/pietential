 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Physiological Needs: 
    Your Score: 65/100</b>
    
    Your physiological needs are in pretty good shape. You seem to be taking good care of yourself regarding your general health and well-being, and there's room for improvement.

A long and healthy life is within your reach, because you have a solid physiological foundation to work from. You'd be wise to work with a nutritionist and personal trainer, and start dialing in your nutrition and exercise regimen in to your specific needs, considering factors like your age, weight, BMI, and very specific health goals.

A key to maintaining, and growing your good physiological foundation is the company you keep. You'd do well to keep your distance from people that smoke, drink excessively, or are recreational drug users, as their lifestyles run counter to yours, and could hinder your progress to an even healthier life.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Safety Needs: 
    Your Score: 61/100</b>
    
    You have a reasonable amount of certainty in your life regarding fundamental issues of safety and security, and that allows you to act from a spirit of abundance, rather than scarcity.

This foundation of safety gives you a strong basis of emotional balance and personal fortitude, and makes you a rational actor in times when issues like housing security, food security, and personal safety might be in question. You know what safety and security in these areas look and feel like, thus you know that they are always attainable, even if life circumstances sometimes raise temporary doubts about them.

Your core relationship to money is likely a healthy one, which is a key part of your foundation regarding the issues above. All the same you might consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial advisor, or retirement specialists and developing a long-term plan to maintain and grow your financial assets over time. Doing so can alleviate some of the unspoken anxieties you might feel in these areas, freeing up your attention to apply to other important areas of your life.

    Your Score: 53/100</b>
    
Your relationships aren’t as deep and fulfilling as they could be, and (hard as it may be to hear) you’re likely at the root of any deficit you might be feeling regarding love, and belonging.
    
Shallow or negative social interactions, unhealthy friendships, and poor relationships with our family are often the result of a lack of compassion for ourselves - from ourselves.  If we don’t show ourselves compassion, if we can’t be intimate with ourselves, if we can’t drop our defenses, and engage in play and truly enjoy our own company how can we expect to show up authentically, and have more meaningful relationships with our family, friends, and community?

Moreover, if we aren’t intimate with ourselves, and showing ourselves and our friends, families and communities our compassion,  our passion, and our natural unadulterated, playful spirit, then what signals are we putting out to the world, and thus what types of people are we attracting? 

People are like magnets for similarly minded people, and we tend to draw to us people who are similar to what we’re consciously, or subconsciously putting out there.

You might consider taking an inventory of your relationships with your friends and family, and taking a look at the communities in which you’re involved.  How are those people showing up?  Are they negative?  Positive?  Compassionate? Cold and unfeeling?  Do they show empathy and connectedness?  Are their relationships deep or shallow?  Are they ok being vulnerable and playful, or are they closed off?  Are they authentic, or just operating with others at the level of pretense.  And how about you?  Where can you improve these important areas of your life, and what might be possible for you with an increased opening for love and belonging.

You might consider working with a life coach, joining a faith-based community, or taking some self improvement courses.  What you’ll find in any of those instances is a broader, deeper understanding, and acceptance of your self, which will in turn give you the opportunity to be naturally more connected to others.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Self-Esteem and Contribution: 
    Your Score: 60/100</b>
    
You have strong, healthy self esteem, and you're a contributor in this world - and there's an important relationship between the two. Your ability to contribute to the world is likely based in your foundation of self esteem, whereas some people's self esteem is dependent on feeling that they make or have made, and are recognized for their contributions. Good self esteem, which is often rooted in positive childhood life experiences, allows us to be contributors to society as an end unto itself, not as a means to fill a perceived void in ourselves.

You may or may not have really come to understand, or embrace your purpose in life - but it's a great time to begin considering these big questions in life, because defining, articulating, and sharing your purpose with others could result in your becoming a super-contributor.

Contributors affect change in society at the interpersonal level, and at the group level - and that's amazing in and of itself. Super-contributors affect the world at the community and at the meta level, and even the global level - and you're capable of that.

Studying from teachers, mentors, and coaches who are operating a level or two up from where your currently affecting change would be of benefit to you if you're interested in operating at a higher level, and development course work, would speed your trajectory towards those aims.

 <b style='font-size:20px;'>Self Actualization: 
    Your Score: 53/100</b>
    
Self Actualization is a process - not a result.
    
We are never completely self actualized, though hopefully we are continually self actualizing.  See, all of us are just a work in progress.  The quintessential question is “are we actively working on it?  Am I actively working on me?”. 
 
The answer is “yes”.  You are working on it - right now, in fact.  You’re working on you - and that’s a good thing.

As you know, none of us are perfect, and it’s our nature as humans to seek to improve our lot in life, and our life itself. 

Self actualizing people are people who actively engage in this process of “self-improvement” by focusing first on the Self itself; by focusing on their “Being” - and on being the best being they are capable of being, as fundamental to their well being.

You might feel inadequate in this regard.  Many people do.

Self actualization looks like a long, steep road of self improvement, where you have to constantly fix yourself - but you should consider that choosing to consciously improve your Self does not mean that you’re broken.  You are not broken and you don’t need to be “fixed”. 

You are fundamentally good, and no matter what your state or situation - you can improve your Self itself, and other areas of your life will follow suit: your self esteem, your ability to be a contributor in life, your relationships and sense of belonging, your feelings of safety and security, and your physiological balance.

“Self Actualization” isn’t a result of having gained some level of achievement in the other fundamental areas of your life.  The work of continually self actualizing, is a propellent towards further improvement in all of those areas of life.

Learning and living your purpose in life, seeking education in all of its forms towards practicing the mastery of new skills and achieving the goals that support your purpose to the point where you feel genuinely fulfilled, and capable of imbuing the possibility of that level of fulfillment to others; today, tomorrow, and the next day, until your short time on this Earth has passed. That’s a self actualizing life - and you’re on living it. 

Keep living it. Keep sharing it.
