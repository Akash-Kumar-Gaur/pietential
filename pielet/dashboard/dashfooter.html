        this website. It will notify you of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and
            with whom it may be shared.
            <br></li>
        <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
            <br></li>
        <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.

        <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b>
        <br></p>
    <p>We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact
        from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your
        information with any third party outside of our organization, other than in the event of the sale of the
        Pietential platform.</p>
    <p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products
        or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
    <p><b>Your Access to and Control Over Information</b>
        <br>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by
        contacting us via the email address given on our website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span></span>See what data we have about you, if any.
            <br></li>
        <li><span></span>Change/correct any data we have about you.

    </ul>
    <p><b>Security</b>
        <br>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website,
        your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
    <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
        transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and
        looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>
    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
        offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, data entry) are
        granted access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately&nbsp;via email.
    </p>
