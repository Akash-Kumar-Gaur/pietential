Understand how your True Self reveals itself and what it asks of<br> you. You’ll live with true spontaneity, not according to a preconceived formula.  </p><br><p>Challenges and temptations will become powerful opportunities for discovery as you<br> come into greater integrity instead of threats. It’s not about perfection; mistakes are part<br> of the journey.</p><br><p>It’s not about other people; it’s about you!

It brings tremendous freedom from external pressures.</p><p>There is satisfaction in Be-ing more that fills the space left by doing less.</p><p>You won’t have to struggle to let go of the agitation of doing; you’ll be grateful for it.</p><p>Being who you are is the greatest and most rare achievement in life.</p><p>Things still need to get done, but instead of internalizing the busy-ness and anxiety of modern life, you’ll be able to decide for yourself what’s really important. You will reclaim and direct your life and energy toward what’s meaningful for you.</p><p>Your presence with others will be more settled, solid, stable, and less agitated. You will be confident in knowing who and what you are, regardless of what you do. This will inspire other people to trust their essential being and feel more freedom to step out of busy-ness.</p><p>Finally, you’ll be less tempted to do things that aren’t aligned with your Being and better able to sense what your True Self is calling you to do; what has meaning, supports healthy growth, and Self-Actualization.</p><p>When you’re in touch with Be-ing as the source of doing, although you may do less, what you do will have more purpose and impact—for yourself and others. You’ll know it is serving the greater good.</p><p>You’ll be a more authentic friend, parent, and co-worker. People will value both your Be-ing and your doing.</p><br>",

All the things that try to convince<br> you that you’re wasting your time.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">Deeply examine that resistance.

As you take further advantage of these opportunities, joy will naturally grow and begin to overshadow negative states spontaneously. When you begin to practice unconditional joy you will become a source of joy for others rather than being dependent on others for joy. This will empower you to have greater mastery and freedom in your journey of self-actualization and establish a solid foundation for genuine, healthy self-esteem that is unconditional. It will improve your health and wellbeing, both physically and psychologically.  </p><p>You are making a powerful shift towards self-determination and genuine inner fulfillment that is not dependent on outer conditions.</p>",

By letting go<br> of the pressures, expectations, and limitations of the Artificial Self, you will experience<br> much more freedom and relaxation.</p><br><p>Second, you will be able to explore a whole new range of possibilities for how you want<br> to live your life. And these emerge from your Authentic Self once you permit yourself to<br> go beyond the artificial limitations of the false self.</p><br><p>It’s not that you will abandon your roles and commitments, such as being a parent. But<br> you will be able to fulfill those roles in a way that is true to your deepest sense of self.<br>  And you will be able to let go of things that limit you unnecessarily in favor of things that<br> liberate you.</p><br><p>You’ll make decisions based more on what is truly meaningful to you than what you<br> have always assumed you have to do.</p>",

This can make good relationships even more fulfilling and bring greater depth and connection to currently extrinsic relationships.</p><p>Second, acknowledging a relationship with seemingly little possibility of becoming more meaningful will free you to focus your attention where there is more potential for healthy growth.</p><p>Love &amp; Belonging is essential for genuine wellbeing, Self-Esteem, and Self-Actualization. It’s also an important aspect of meeting your more basic Physiological and Safety Needs.</p><p>Love &amp; Belonging is a function of community; it’s not something you can do by yourself. But you can take an active part in cultivating a healthy environment of genuine care that supports healthy growth.</p><p>It’s like plants that thrive in a rich and flourishing ecosystem, an interconnected web of life. All individual plants do much better in such an environment than they would on their own, and each plays a part in contributing to the strength of the whole.</p><p>This exercise will help you create a robust ecosystem of mutually beneficial relationships that nurture your wellbeing and the flourishing of others—both outwardly and inwardly.</p>",

This will help you speak more authentically and enable you to hear and notice things about others you might otherwise miss. Others will feel the quality of your authentic presence when you give them your full attention. And although it will not magically transform your interactions, it will definitely improve the quality of interaction and people will be more inclined to give their full attention to you.</p><p>You will be taking the initiative in deepening the quality of your relationships rather than leaving it to chance and you will become an active agent of care in the world, simply by sharing your presence fully.</p><p>Along with other practices it will help you gather and intentionally direct your attention, which is crucial to well-being, self-esteem, and self-actualization. At the same time, you will be improving the quality of your connections which will enhance your experience of love and belonging and open possibilities for others to experience deeper levels of communication and connection as well</p>",

This is what happens when you<br> integrate the others’ needs with your own, by <b>Serving Others you Serve Yourself</b><b>.</b></p><br><p>People spend a lot of money to live in gated communities where paid professionals<br> handle security but the bonds of community have withered.

You don’t have to make it a project; just pay attention<br> to them and their needs. The fabric of community is sewn in small ways. It could<br> be a simple as noticing that they left their door open and offering to close it for<br> them. They will notice your care.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">Be alert, attentive and inquisitive, but not intrusive.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">Look for reciprocity, not because you expect something in return, but because it<br> will let you know how much potential for collaboration there is. A strong<br> community depends on collaborative relationships between people.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">You can look for ways to make it more formal or participate in existing projects<br> and organizations, but you don’t have to.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">Simply engaging with people in this way will begin to generate an atmosphere of<br> mutual protection.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">Of course, it would be naïve to think that nothing bad will ever happen just<br> because of good intentions alone. It’s important to have the ability to respond to<br> extreme situations when the need arises. This could mean calling the police or<br> fire department. It could also mean taking a self-defense or a first aid course and<br> identifying members of your community with relevant expertise in security, etc.</p></li></ul><br><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">But the point here is that true safety is a property of healthy community, not<br> dominance and control.</p></li></ul><br>",

Learning to live in a way that honors and balances outer and inner needs is a core principle at the heart of the Pietential Life Balance System. It’s the common thread that runs through Physiological Needs, Safety Needs, Love &amp; Belonging, Self-Esteem, and Self-Actualization, weaving them together in an integrated whole.<br>When you fully integrate this understanding, whichever category you work with will naturally bear fruit in the others, just like cultivating a healthy garden. This is because they are not actually separate at all. They are just different facets of an integrated whole, the holistic reality of your life journey.<br>It’s okay to have needs! There is no shame in seeking help from others. In fact, it’s essential for your health and the healthy integration of the wider community. But it’s vital to differentiate between genuine needs (outer or inner) and wants/desires. And it’s also important to distinguish between outer and inner needs—understand how to meet them separately, and know how they support one another.<br><br>Excessive self-reliance is harmful to you and the environment, just as much as excessive dependence and exploitation.<br><br>Taking this practice to heart will transform your life. You will experience a profound shift in your orientation to the world and other people in the first few months. As you deepen your integration with this practice over the years, you will be better able to see how your wellbeing and that of the whole are intimately connected. Your ability to live in a mutually beneficial way to yourself and others, both outwardly and inwardly, will increase as you see that connection more clearly in all situations and recognize how to act accordingly.<br><br>",

It will help you increase the presence of joy in your life and gain greater access to unconditional joy. You will become more confident that joy is part of your essential nature and that it is a powerful force for healing and wellbeing. This is liberating and empowering. You will learn that joy and pain can share the same space without conflict. Learning how this applies to you will help you bring this truth to others who are suffering by sharing joy with them through gentle confidence.  </p><p>This exercise focuses on joy as a source of healing and empowerment to help you overcome the limiting focus on self-gratification and transition into higher levels of self-actualization by orienting towards service to others.  </p><p>This is not done through self-sacrifice by placing others’ interests before your own. Rather, it is done through radical self-care that recognizes that your interests and that of others are not in competition. It shows that they are in harmony.</p><p>Being joyfully present as your authentic self simultaneously accomplishes the genuine benefit (the gift of) yourself to others.</p><p>When you are tempted to give in to the influence of negative emotions that may cause harm to yourself and others, you will be better able to hold a perspective of lightness and humor, and allow the presence of joy to reveal possibilities for more constructive outcomes.</p>",

This is where the true wealth of abundance and freedom from the fear and anxiety of scarcity is found.</p><p>When others witness your relaxation and freedom from fear through your presence it helps them see the same possibility for themselves.  They can be at more ease in the world and with themselves.  You’re not just tending to their Physiological Needs.  By sharing your Authentic Self, you help them connect with their Authentic Self as well.  </p><p>Discovering the wholeness and richness of natural abundance transforms life from a fearful, competitive struggle for survival into a journey of Self-Actualization.  Once you discover this for yourself it is natural to share it with others.  </p><p>As simple as they are, these exercises are a powerful and important step in that direction.  Embodying them is a direct way to improve the lives of others.</p><p>The emphasis is not on ‘<i>giving</i>’ but on generosity as <b>A State of Being</b> (link A State of Being, Not Doing), the relaxed and open quality of presence.  Giving or not giving is a natural expression of what is appropriate in each situation.  From this state of openness, you will discover endless opportunities to practice generosity in countless ways.  Every interaction becomes an invitation to joyful abundance without struggle.  </p><p>Your presence in the world will be a source of comfort and liberation for others.  Without pretending or artificially forcing it, your mere presence is generous.  You will be planting seeds that can grow into a culture of abundant generosity alleviating the fear of scarcity and separation.  As you gain more confidence to live in the natural generosity of inner and outer abundance, others will be inspired to join you and generosity will flow more and more freely.</p><p>Spreading Abundance has the power to transform the lives of individuals and transform the social environment from one of competition and alienation to one of mutual care and flourishing.</p>",

This is especially important for potentially difficult situations!</p></li></ul>All kinds of situations can trigger contraction, so generosity can express itself in countless ways depending on the situation.  It could mean holding a door, letting someone go ahead of you in line, or not getting angry when another driver does something you disapprove of.  It might be letting someone speak and giving them your full attention or letting someone make a mistake without condemnation.  It might simply be letting go of your agenda and trying to control a situation to get the outcome you want.  Material generosity, such as giving money, food, etc. is only one, limited expression of generosity.  You will notice many more possibilities and have many more tools at your disposal when you understand that abundance isn’t limited in that way.  Generosity is a state of openness and non-territoriality that can express itself in infinite ways according to each unique situation.<br>",
