<p><b><span>Self Actualization: Your score: 100/100</span></b><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Suggestions for improvement:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>You seem to be aware that self actualization is a process - not a result, and you're consciously
        self-actualizing (seeking to be the best you that you can be) knowing well what effect that has on you, and
        others around you.</span></p>
<p><span>Your innate desire to be your most authentic self is an inspiration to so many people who may not have come to
        know, accept, or embrace themselves in the way in which you have. The world would benefit greatly from you
        working just as hard to express yourself to others, as you do to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>Your gift is being you. Share yourself openly with the world, and lead by example. Shine your light as bright
        as you possibly can, and others will follow. You may light up the world someday, and you'll definitely light up
        a few faces, and light some minds on fire along the way.</span></p>
<p><span>Whatever you do - don't stop. Keep seeking knowledge, wisdom, and mentorship towards the things that are truly
        important to you - and share it openly.</span></p>
<p><span>Teaching is learning.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Self-Esteem and Contribution: Your score: 100/100</span></b><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Suggestions for improvement:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>You have a strong, healthy self-esteem, and you're a contributor in this world - and there's an important
        relationship between the two.</span></p>
<p><span>Your ability to contribute to the world is likely based in your foundation of self-esteem, whereas some
        people's self-esteem is dependent on feeling that they make (or have made) and are recognized for their
        contributions. Good self-esteem, which is often rooted in positive childhood life experiences, allows us to be
        contributors to society as an end unto itself, not as a means to fill a perceived void within ourselves.</span>
</p>
<p><span>You may or may not have really come to understand, or embrace your purpose in life - but it's a great time to
        begin considering big questions like this, because defining, articulating, and sharing your purpose with others
        could result in your becoming a super-contributor.</span></p>
<p><span>Contributors affect change in society at the interpersonal level, and at the group level - and that's amazing
        in and of itself. Super-contributors affect the world at the community and at the meta level, and even the
        global level, and you're capable of that.</span></p>
<p><span>Studying from teachers, mentors, and coaches who are operating a level or two up from where you are currently
        affecting change would be of benefit to you if you're interested in operating at a higher level. Some personal
        development course work would also speed your trajectory towards those aims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Love and Belonging: Your score: 100/100</span></b><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Suggestions for improvement:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>Your relationship with yourself is a good one. You love yourself, and have compassion for yourself - and that's
        the root of love and compassion your able to show others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Authenticity is an important lever in the realm of love and belonging, and you probably show up pretty
        authentically in the groups and communities in which you operate. Continue this practice, and work to become
        ever more authentic, as it will increase you compassion for your fellow being and embed you even deeper into
        your community as a compassionate leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your love for yourself allows you a certain level of intimacy with yourself that not everyone has access too,
        and that level of personal intimacy transcends you and works its way into your personal relationships. People
        are okay being intimate with you, whether in conversation, or physically, because you're okay with intimacy. You
        radiate this in your words, actions and being - and people are attracted to you, because of
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your foundation of love and belonging is a strong one, and with some additional nurturing, and perhaps some
        formal training, you could become a true force for compassion and healing in your world. You might consider
        taking some personal development courses, in order to increase your natural capacity for love and
        belonging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, be careful not to take on too much. Your natural strength in this area can be a beacon to
        people who feel deficient in this realm, drawing them to you as they seek your energy and love in order to
        compensate for their own lack of sense of love and belonging.</span></p>
<p><span>Being present, powerful and compassionate towards others can in fact give you energy, but only when you have it
        to give. Make sure that your own needs in this area are well taken care of so you don't over-extend yourself and
        begin to feel drained by something that should give you joy.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Safety Needs: Your score: 100/100</span></b><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Suggestions for improvement:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>You have a reasonable amount of certainty in your life regarding fundamental issues of safety and security, and
        that allows you to act from a spirit of abundance, rather than scarcity.</span></p>
<p><span>This foundation of safety gives you a strong basis of emotional balance and personal fortitude, and makes you a
        rational actor in times when issues like housing security, food security, and personal safety might be in
        question. You know what safety and security in these areas look and feel like, thus you know that they are
        always attainable, even if life circumstances sometimes raise temporary doubts about them.</span></p>
<p><span>Your core relationship to money is likely a healthy one, which is a key part of your foundation regarding the
        issues above. All the same, you might consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial advisor, or
        retirement specialists and developing a long-term plan to maintain and grow your financial assets over time.
        Doing so can alleviate some of the unspoken anxieties you might feel in these areas, freeing up your attention
        to apply to other important areas of your life.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Physiological Needs: Your score: 85/100</span></b><b><span> </span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Suggestions for improvement:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>Your physiological needs are in pretty good shape. You seem to be taking good care of yourself regarding your
        general health and well-being, and there's always room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span>A long and healthy life is within your reach, because you have a solid physiological foundation to work from.
        You'd be wise to work with a nutritionist and/or personal trainer, and start dialing in your nutrition and
        exercise regimen in to your specific needs, considering factors like your age, weight, BMI, and your own very
        specific health goals.</span></p>
<p><span>A key to maintaining, and growing your good physiological foundation is the company you keep. You'd do well to
        keep your distance from people that smoke, drink excessively, or are recreational drug users, as their
        lifestyles run counter to yours, and could hinder your progress towards an even healthier life.</span><span>
